# Back To Basics

### At the heart of it, data analysis is the process of asking a question and working towards an answer.

In most disciplines, this involves the traditional process of:

1. Ask a question
2. Form a hypothesis
3. Make a prediction
4. Test the prediction
5. Adjust and repeat

For us (data analysts) it looks a little more like this:

- Data Exists
- Analyze the data
- Visualize the data
- Investigate trends
- Tell the story of the data

It's not a linear flow like the traditional method and you never formally ask a question. Yet, you are constantly answering questions along the way. You may backtrack on the process to analyze something interesting you've found or because you didn't get the results you were looking for. The last step, however, is a constant. Telling the story of your data effectively can be the difference between a successful study and mediocre one.

# More Than Numbers

The value of your work may be evaluated by the accuracy of your number-crunching but it is judged by your ability to share your findings.
